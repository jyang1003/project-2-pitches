# TFT Team Builder

---
## Project 2 Goals
Teamfight Tactics is a game designed by Riot Games in the format of autochess. My app TFT Team Builder will be using the Riot Games TFT JSON data package in order to use that data to theory-craft and build your own TFT teams. This project will be using Javascript, express, node.js, and postgres. I will be have three models for the user, champion, and team data.
